Incorporating ethics, fairness, safety and security within the data collection, storage and manipulation practices are much broader and bigger topics that requires contributions from the multiple teams and the management of an organization including the considerations of the prevailing laws (like GDPR, HIPAA, PIPEDA, CCPA standards) and the moral standards.

As a practitioner in data management, these consideration starts from the conceptual design that spans across the logical and physical models to the level where each column's requirement is evaluated, the datatype of that column is considered, and the best practices are incorporated when it comes to the overall ETL (extract, transform, load) processes and various CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations.

For example, in the homeworks and the assignment of this course work, the customer, vendor, employee information should be anonymized wherever possible and should be protected against any unauthorized accesses. In queries involving purchases, inventories, shift information careful considerations should be given to data accuracy and the implications of any data manipulation operations. Any incorrect data updates or unauthorized accesses could lead to misinformation and even breach of trust. Similarly, when it comes to data collection and analysis/reporting, it should be done responsibly allowing to capture only the essential data and that too for intended purposes only.

Data practices should not reinforce any existing biases or create unfair outcomes. In queries, where quantities and sales are analyzed, itâ€™s important to recognize that different vendors or products might have different levels of visibility or accesses to resources. All vendors should be treated fairly, and no single vendor or product is unfairly disadvantaged by the data reporting or analysis process.Likewise, when considering customer or employee data, it is crucial to avoid any existing biases that may arise from demographic information. Queries should be designed to be inclusive and fair, avoiding any outcomes that could affect certain groups of customers or vendors or employees.
